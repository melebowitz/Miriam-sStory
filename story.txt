Once upon there was a UW Madison student named Ryan who sat outside Bascom Hall at a table with a cup of coffee and a computer. On the front of the table was a sign for one of thousands of clubs at the university. What had seemed like a usual occurrence, soon exploded into one of the most common meme formats on the infamous UW Madison Memes for Milk Chugging Teens page. 

Ryan however turned out to be lactose intolearnt. Figuring it out only years after his recent obsession with milk, he realised what a waste of time it all was. The milk, the lactose bacterium, the milk and oh, how can I forget the milk... Now he decided to move onto his new addiction: ice creams! Because ice-cream is perfectly consummable by any lactose intolerant.. Right? 

Ryan decided to start up his own ice cream store for the lactose intolerant. He named his new store ICE CREAM? After two years he profited 3 billion dollars seeing as there was a high demand for such an item. The store had every flavor anyone could ask for including chocolate peanut butter, coffee ginger,and salt licorice. His business continued to be successful and he eventually retired at age 22.  

But his retirement only extended to his job at the ice cream store. Inspired by what he had accomplished and his increased presence on the UW Madison Meme page, he decided to set out and change the dairy culture in Madison, and around the U.S. Ryan continues to be an iconic milk chugging teen to this day, and people around the world are continuing to enjoy his ice cream everyday.
