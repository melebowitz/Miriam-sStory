Once upon there was a UW Madison student named Ryan who sat outside Bascom Hall at a table with a cup of coffee and a computer. On the front of the table was a sign for one of thousands of clubs at the university. What had seemed like a usual occurrence, soon exploded into one of the most common meme formats on the infamous UW Madison Memes for Milk Chugging Teens page. 

Ryan however turned out to be lactose intolearnt. Figuring it out only years after his recent obsession with milk, he realised what a waste of time it all was. The milk, the lactose bacterium, the milk and oh, how can I forget the milk... Now he decided to move onto his new addiction: ice creams! Because ice-cream is perfectly consummable by any lactose intolerant.. Right?
